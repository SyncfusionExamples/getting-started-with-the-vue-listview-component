# Getting Started With the Vue ListView Component
A quick-start Vue project showing how to start with the Syncfusion Vue ListView component.
Learn how easily you can create and configure the Vue ListView component of Syncfusion and how to configure basic features like binding data, grouping list items, adding checkboxes to a list, and adding nested list items. 

The Vue ListView component is a list-like interface that allows you to select an item or multiple items. It represents data in an interactive hierarchical structure across different layouts or views which supports UI virtualization to improve performance while loading huge amounts of data. This creates a fixed number of items regardless of data volume and displays the relevant data instead of creating all items simultaneously.

Powerful data binding allows data to be loaded from an array of primitive data, JSON data collections, or remote data sources. It supports complex data with field mapping; different kinds of data services such as OData, OData V4, and web API; and data formats such as XML, JSON, JSONP, CSV, and HTML tables.
